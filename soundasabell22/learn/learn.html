				</div>
				<div class="flip-box-back">	
					<p>The xun is an ancient wind instrument made of mud or clay and resembles an egg, with flat bottom. Although not possible to determine how old the instrument is, all findings have shown that it has a long history.
					   The Chinese xun was mainly used to perform court music, but it was also played amongst the common people.
					 During that period, the xun was known to possess only one to five playing holes. Today, xuns that are used in the Chinese orchestra possess up to eight or nine playing holes, thus rendering them able to play a full octave.<p>

				<div class="flip-box-back">	
					<p>The Hardanger fiddle (in Norwegian, hardingfele) is often called the national instrument of Norway and it is similar to the violin. The instrument probably originated in the area around the Hardanger fjord of Norway — whence comes the English language name. 
					   The oldest known fiddle, the "Jaastad Fiddle," may date from as early as 1651. The primary purpose of the hardingfele is to be played for dancers. Hardingfeler can be played for waltz, reinlender/schottis, pols, etc., but are most associated with Norwegian regional dances.<p>

				<div class="flip-box-back">	
					<p>The sarod is a stringed instrument, used mainly in Hindustani music, along with the sitar it is among the most popular and prominent instruments on the Indian subcontinent. It is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality. A fretless instrument, it can produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend (glissandi), which are important in Indian music.<p>

				<div class="flip-box-back">	
					<p>The cuíca is a Brazilian friction drum with a large pitch range, produced by changing tension on the head of the drum. Cuíca is Portuguese for the gray four-eyed opossum (Philander opossum) which is known for its high-pitched cry. It is frequently used in carnivals,[1] as well as often in samba music. The tone it produces has a high-pitched squeaky timbre. It has been called a 'laughing gourd' due to this sound. Many also liken its sound to that of a monkey.

				<div class="flip-box-back">	
					<p>The bandura is the instrument that best embodies the voice and soul of Ukraine. From a musical perspective, the bandura unifies acoustic principles of both the lute and the harp.
					   The modern bandura has between 20 and 65 strings and is tuned like a piano rather than a guitar.
					   Although the bandura can be used to perform complex works like sonatas and concerti, the Ukrainian bandura was historically used as an instrument for vocal accompaniment.

					   Australian Aboriginal people use the bullroarer during initiation ceremonies and other rituals, including burials.
